# Iron - Image Rust Optimizer Node

**Iron** is a cross-platform desktop application for optimizing web images, built with a **Rust** backend and a **SolidJS** frontend on top of **Tauri**.

⚠️ Important note: This project is currently in **pre-alpha** and not yet ready for production use.

## ✨ Planned Features

* **Smart Image Resizing** – presets (4K, 2K, Full HD, HD, SD) with aspect ratio preservation
* **Multi-Format Export** – WebP, JPEG, PNG with configurable compression profiles
* **Parallel Processing** – powered by Rayon’s work-stealing scheduler
* **Real-Time Preview** – before/after comparison with live statistics
* **Batch Operations** – process hundreds of images at once
* **Drag & Drop** – support for files and folders
* **Cross-Platform** – Windows, macOS, and Linux

---

## 🔧 Architecture

* **Core** – Rust + Tauri v2
* **Concurrency** – Rayon, Tokio
* **Image Processing** – TurboJPEG, libwebp, image-rs
* **Frontend** – SolidJS + TypeScript
* **UI** – TailwindCSS + DaisyUI

## ⚡ Performance Focus with Rayon

Iron’s processing pipeline is built around **Rayon**, Rust’s powerful data-parallelism library.

* **Work-Stealing Scheduler** – efficiently balances workloads across all CPU cores
* **Dynamic Scaling** – adapts to available hardware for near 100% utilization
* **Memory-Safe Parallelism** – concurrency without data races, thanks to Rust’s ownership model
* **Batch Efficiency** – designed to handle large sets of high-resolution images with minimal overhead

This makes Iron particularly suited for heavy, parallelizable workloads like bulk image optimization.
