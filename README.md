# Iron - Image Rust Optimizer Node

**Iron** is a cross-platform desktop application for optimizing web images, built with a **Rust** backend and a **SolidJS** frontend on top of **Tauri**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important note: This project is currently in **pre-alpha** and not yet ready for production use.

## ‚ú® Planned Features

* **Smart Image Resizing** ‚Äì presets (4K, 2K, Full HD, HD, SD) with aspect ratio preservation
* **Multi-Format Export** ‚Äì WebP, JPEG, PNG with configurable compression profiles
* **Parallel Processing** ‚Äì powered by Rayon‚Äôs work-stealing scheduler
* **Real-Time Preview** ‚Äì before/after comparison with live statistics
* **Batch Operations** ‚Äì process hundreds of images at once
* **Drag & Drop** ‚Äì support for files and folders
* **Cross-Platform** ‚Äì Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üîß Architecture

* **Core** ‚Äì Rust + Tauri v2
* **Concurrency** ‚Äì Rayon, Tokio
* **Image Processing** ‚Äì TurboJPEG, libwebp, image-rs
* **Frontend** ‚Äì SolidJS + TypeScript
* **UI** ‚Äì TailwindCSS + DaisyUI

## ‚ö° Performance Focus with Rayon

Iron‚Äôs processing pipeline is built around **Rayon**, Rust‚Äôs powerful data-parallelism library.

* **Work-Stealing Scheduler** ‚Äì efficiently balances workloads across all CPU cores
* **Dynamic Scaling** ‚Äì adapts to available hardware for near 100% utilization
* **Memory-Safe Parallelism** ‚Äì concurrency without data races, thanks to Rust‚Äôs ownership model
* **Batch Efficiency** ‚Äì designed to handle large sets of high-resolution images with minimal overhead

This makes Iron particularly suited for heavy, parallelizable workloads like bulk image optimization.
